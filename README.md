Vote-Based Discussion Forum
Sites like Reddit, HackerNews and others offer a collection of different pages or forums where users may post news, pictures, and other information around a certain topic. Other users can then upvote or downvote content. The more upvotes an item receives, the higher it's displayed on the list.

Recreate a basic subreddit and/or vote-based discussion board (around any theme of your choosing) using React. Here are some user stories to get you started:

As a user, I want to enter content into a form and submit to create a new post.
As a user, I want to upvote posts I particularly enjoy.
As a user, I want to downvote posts I don't like, or find inappropriate.
As a user, I want to easily see how many upvotes/downvotes a post has.
Further Exploration
If you're able to complete everything above, consider either selecting an additional exercise from the weekly Further Exploration lesson (below), or adding the following additional user stories to your forum:

As a user, I'd like posts with the most upvotes to appear higher on the page. (We haven't explicitly covered this in our lessons, but here are some hints: Writing JavaScript sorting logic is a common interview question. And in React, JavaScript logic can always appear before a return statement.)
As a user, I want my new posts to include a timestamp of some kind. And I want to see when other listings were posted, too. (This will require you read ahead to tonight's homework!)
As a user, I want to click a post to view additional details. For now simply hide/show some message content. (Fair warning: This is a little more advanced, and we haven't discussed how to do this. But, do a little research and give it your best shot!)
